Installation 
==============
Python 2.7.6 or higher
wxPython

Standalone Binary
==============
This the stand alone version which does not require python installed to run the application

Developers
==============
I use the latest version of wxFormBuilder to use to design the GUI
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/)
Make sure to backup the original files before regenerating the GUI files.
With changes in the GUI make sure make a copy to be able to port over the changes quickly as the program wipes the files clean of any changes and creates new files.

Pyinstaller
==============
just run the py2exe.bat in the source code folder to compile the py script to a windows exe version for distribution for though who do not have python installed
