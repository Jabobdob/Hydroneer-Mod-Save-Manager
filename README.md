Developers
==============
I use the latest version of wxFormBuilder to use to design the GUI
[https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxformbuilder/)
Make sure to backup the original files before regenerating the GUI files.
With changes in the GUI make sure make a copy to be able to port over the changes quickly as the program wipes the files clean of any changes and creates new files.
